Welcome to your first day at Rutgers University. Do your best to avoid the RUSCREW and successfully navigate the campus. Below will be a map of where you can go and move around. 

-------------------------------------------------------
|      SCI    |   Records Hall   |   Honors College   |
-------------------------------------------------------
|  Crosswalk  |      Brower      | Academice Building |
-------------------------------------------------------
|     Gym     |  Student Center  |       Yard         |
-------------------------------------------------------


You can move forward, move left, move right, move backward or give up. 

If you want to be able to make it through the first day, you must be able to pick up all the items before your self esteem turns to 0. 

Good luck! And hopefully you don't get RUScrewed.
